## Main flow

The main flow is a very basic way to monitor the (test) project advancement.

Given you have a project (application under test or AUT) and a new version will be produced when the implementation 
start then your test starts.

You will record all tickets in the version. You will estimate the workload to test each ticket and, you will be able 
to foresee an end date. With this work, you will also check that each ticket is really testable and highlight 
reasons a ticket is not testable.

You can then send a first test plan with the scope, the impediments and, the estimations. 

You can monitor each ticket status from recorded to done and check bugs (if you have no bug tracking tool) on the 
version.

## Using one campaign occurrence

## Using multiple campaign occurrence
Depending on your workflow, you will be able to send alongside the scenarios to be executed on each (testable) ticket.
